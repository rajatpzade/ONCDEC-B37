## 🐧 Introduction to Linux
Linux is an **open-source operating system kernel** widely used in DevOps, Cloud, and Servers.

### Why Linux for DevOps?
- Strong CLI
- Secure & stable
- Lightweight
- Server-friendly
- Used in AWS, Docker, Kubernetes

---

## 🏗️ Architecture of Linux
Linux has five main layers:
- Hardware
- Kernel
- shell 
- User Applications

![Alt Text](img/Linux_arch.png)


### Kernel : 
    In simple terms, the Linux kernel is the core of the operating system that acts as a translator between software and hardware. It manages essential resources like the CPU and memory, and handles all communication, allowing applications to run without needing to know the specific details of the computer's hardware.  


### Shell :
```
A Linux shell is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system's core, known as the kernel
```

### Hardware :

```
 Linux hardware is any physical component of a computer, like the CPU, RAM, and storage drives, that the Linux operating system manages and interacts

```

## Day-3 📌 Understanding the Linux Command Prompt
The **Linux command prompt** is where you type commands to interact with the operating system.  
It is the most powerful tool for DevOps engineers.

---

## 🧩 Decoding the Structure of the Command Prompt
A typical Linux prompt looks like this:

``
username@hostname:~$
``


**Breakdown:**
- `username` → Current logged-in user  
- `@` → Separator  
- `hostname` → System name  
- `:` → Separator  
- `~` → Current directory (home directory)  
- `$` → Normal user prompt (`#` for root user)

---

## 🧭 Effective Command Prompt Usage: A Step-by-Step Guide
- Identify your **user** and **location**  
- Understand the **$** vs **#** prompt difference  
- Use **TAB** for auto-completion  
- Use **UP/DOWN arrows** to navigate history  
- Use **CTRL + C** to stop running commands  
- Use **clear** or **CTRL + L** to clean the screen  

---

## 🎨 Making the Command Prompt Your Own (Advanced Customization)
You can customize your prompt by editing the PS1 variable.

Example:

`
PS1="\u@\h:\w$ "
`

Meaning:  
- `\u` → Username  
- `\h` → Hostname  
- `\w` → Working directory  

*This topic is advanced; beginners can skip customization.*

---

## 🐧 Introduction to Linux Basic Commands
Here are the most commonly used beginner commands:

- `pwd` → Show current directory  
- `ls` → List files  
- `cd` → Change directory  
- `clear` → Clear terminal  
- `whoami` → Show current user  
- `date` → Show current date and time  
- `history` → Show command history  
- `echo` → Print text  

---

## 🖥️ Getting Started with the Linux Terminal
The **terminal** is the interface where you type commands.

- GNOME Terminal  
- XTerm  
- Konsole  
- macOS Terminal  
- Windows WSL (for Linux on Windows)

How to open terminal:
- **Linux** → CTRL + ALT + T  
- **Mac** → Spotlight → Terminal  
- **Windows (WSL)** → wsl command  

---

## 🧾 Essential System Information Commands
- `uname -a` → Complete system details  
- `hostname` → Show system name  
- `uptime` → System load & running time  
- `date` → Current system date/time  
- `df -h` → Disk usage  
- `du -sh` → Size of a directory  
- `free -h` → RAM usage  
- `top` → Real-time processes  
- `who` → Logged-in users  

---
## 📂 Navigating the File System
Linux file system ek tree structure jaisa hota hai, jiska root `/` hota hai.

### 🔹 Basic Navigation Commands
- `pwd` → Show current directory  
- `ls` → List files  
- `ls -l` → Detailed list  
- `ls -a` → Show hidden files  
- `cd foldername` → Enter a folder  
- `cd ..` → Go one level back  
- `cd /` → Go to root  
- `cd ~` → Go to home  
- `cd /path/location` → Go to specific path  

### 🔸 Example:

`pwd  `

`ls -l  `

`cd /etc  `

`cd ..  `

`cd ~  `


---

## 📁 File and Directory Management

### 🔹 Creating Directories
`mkdir foldername  `
`mkdir -p a/b/c  `

### 🔹 Creating Files
`touch file.txt`

`touch file1 file2 file3 ` 

### 🔹 Copying Files
`cp file1 file2 `
 
`cp file.txt /path/location/` 

`cp -r folder1 folder2 `

### 🔹 Moving / Renaming Files
`mv oldname newname`  
`mv file.txt /path/ ` 

### 🔹 Deleting Files & Folders
`rm file.txt ` 
`rm -r foldername`  
`rm -rf foldername`   (⚠️ dangerous)  

---

## 📝 Viewing and Editing Files

### 🔹 Viewing Content
`cat file.txt`  
`less file.txt`  
`head file.txt`  
tail file.txt  
`tail -f file.txt `  (live logs)  

### 🔹 Editing Files
`nano file.txt  `
`vi file.txt  `

### 🔸 Example:
`cat /etc/os-release ` 
`head -20 logs.txt`  
`tail -f /var/log/syslog ` 
`vim notes.txt ` 

---

`mv script.sh /usr/local/bin/`  
`mv *.txt documents/`  

### 🔹 Delete Examples
`rm temp.txt  `
`rm -r old-backup ` 
`rm -rf /tmp/testfolder`   (⚠️ irreversible)  

---

## ⭐ Real-Time DevOps Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Create a project structure  
`mkdir -p project/{src,logs,configs} ` 

### Scenario 2: Move a downloaded file  
`mv Downloads/file.sh project/scripts/  `

### Scenario 3: Check logs while deployment  
`tail -20 /var/log/app.log`  

### Scenario 4: Backup config before editing  
`cp nginx.conf nginx.conf.backup  `
`vim nginx.conf ` 


## 🎯 The Significance of the Linux File System Hierarchy
- Organizes files in a predictable structure  
- Ensures security through permissions  
- Makes automation easy  
- Helps in troubleshooting logs, configs & binaries  
- Every directory ka apna specific purpose hota hai  

Example:  
- Config files hamesha `/etc` me honge  
- Logs hamesha `/var/log` me honge  
- User data `/home` ke andar hoga

- Jab aap Vim open karte ho → aap Command Mode me hote ho.

### 🔹 2. Insert Mode
- Text type karne ke liye.  
- Enter using: `i`, `a`, `o`, `I`, `A`, `O`

### 🔹 3. Visual Mode
- Select text for copying, deleting, changing.  
- Enter using: `v`, `V`, `CTRL + v`

### 🔹 4. Execute/Ex Mode (Command-Line Mode)
- File save, quit, replace, search commands.  
- Enter using `:` (colon)
