### Kernel : 
    In simple terms, the Linux kernel is the core of the operating system that acts as a translator between software and hardware. It manages essential resources like the CPU and memory, and handles all communication, allowing applications to run without needing to know the specific details of the computer's hardware.  


### Shell :
```
A Linux shell is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system's core, known as the kernel
```

### Hardware :

```
 Linux hardware is any physical component of a computer, like the CPU, RAM, and storage drives, that the Linux operating system manages and interacts

```

- `@` → Separator  
- `hostname` → System name  
- `:` → Separator  
- `~` → Current directory (home directory)  
- `$` → Normal user prompt (`#` for root user)

---

## 🧭 Effective Command Prompt Usage: A Step-by-Step Guide
- Identify your **user** and **location**  
- Understand the **$** vs **#** prompt difference  
- Use **TAB** for auto-completion  
- Use **UP/DOWN arrows** to navigate history  
- Use **CTRL + C** to stop running commands  
- Use **clear** or **CTRL + L** to clean the screen  

---

## 🎨 Making the Command Prompt Your Own (Advanced Customization)
You can customize your prompt by editing the PS1 variable.

Example:

`
PS1="\u@\h:\w$ "
`

Meaning:  
- `\u` → Username  
- `\h` → Hostname

```bash
sudo useradd -m -g developers -G docker,sudo alice
```
**What happens?**
- User `alice` created  
- Primary group: `developers`  
- Secondary groups: `docker`, `sudo`  

---

## 🔐 Setting User Passwords

After creating a user, you must set a password.

### 🔹 Using the `passwd` Command

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo passwd username
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Set password for a user
```bash
sudo passwd rajat
```
**Output:**
```
New password: [type password]
Retype new password: [confirm password]
passwd: password updated successfully
```

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Force user to change password on first login
```bash
sudo passwd -e rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User must change password on next login  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Lock a user account
```bash
sudo passwd -l john
```
**What happens?**
- User `john` cannot login  
- Password is locked with `!`  

---

### 🔸 Example 4: Unlock a user account
```bash
sudo passwd -u john
```
**What happens?**
- User `john` can login again  

---

## 👥 Managing User Groups

Groups are used to organize users and assign permissions collectively.

### 🔹 Viewing Groups
```bash
cat /etc/group
```
**Output:**
```
root:x:0:
sudo:x:27:rajat,alice
docker:x:999:rajat
developers:x:1001:alice,bob
```

---

### 🔹 Creating Groups
```bash
sudo groupadd groupname
```

#### 🔸 Example 1: Create a simple group
```bash
sudo groupadd developers
```

#### 🔸 Example 2: Create a group with specific GID
```bash
sudo groupadd -g 2000 devops_team
```

---

### 🔹 Adding User to Group

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username
```

#### 🔸 Example 1: Add user to sudo group
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` can now run commands with `sudo`  

---

#### 🔸 Example 2: Add user to docker group
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` can run Docker commands without `sudo`  

---

#### 🔸 Example 3: Add user to multiple groups
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker,developers,sudo rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` added to three groups  

---

### 🔹 Viewing User's Groups
```bash
groups username
```

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
groups rajat
```
**Output:**
```
rajat : rajat docker developers sudo
```

---

### 🔹 Removing User from Group
```bash
sudo delgroup username groupname
```

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
sudo delgroup rajat docker
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` removed from `docker` group  

---

## 🗑️ Removing Users

### 🔹 Delete User (keep home directory)
```bash
sudo userdel username
```

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
sudo userdel john
```
**What happens?**
- User `john` deleted  
- Home directory `/home/john` still exists  

---

### 🔹 Delete User with Home Directory
```bash
sudo userdel -r username
```

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
sudo userdel -r john
```
**What happens?**
- User `john` deleted  
- Home directory `/home/john` deleted  

---

## 📄 Introduction to Affected Files

User and group information is stored in specific files:

### 🔹 `/etc/passwd`
Stores user account information.

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

**Output:**
```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
rajat:x:1000:1000:Rajat Kumar:/home/rajat:/bin/bash
john:x:1001:1001:John Doe:/home/john:/bin/bash
mysql:x:111:113:MySQL Server:/var/lib/mysql:/bin/false
```

**Format:**
```
username:x:UID:GID:Full Name:Home Directory:Shell
```

---

### 🔹 `/etc/shadow`
Stores encrypted passwords (only root can read).

#### 🔸 View shadow file:
```bash
sudo cat /etc/shadow
```

**Output:**
```
root:!:18305:0:99999:7:::
rajat:$6$abc123....:18305:0:99999:7:::
john:!:18305:0:99999:7:::
```

---

### 🔹 `/etc/group`
Stores group information.

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
cat /etc/group
```

**Output:**
```
root:x:0:
sudo:x:27:rajat,alice
docker:x:999:rajat
developers:x:1001:alice,bob
```

**Format:**
```
groupname:x:GID:members
```

---

## 🏠 User Home Directories

Each user has a personal home directory.

### 🔹 Default Home Directory Location
```bash
/home/username
```

### 🔹 Special Home Directories
- **Root user**: `/root`  
- **Regular users**: `/home/username`  
- **System users**: Varies (e.g., `/var/lib/mysql` for mysql)  

---

### 🔸 Example: View your home directory
```bash
pwd
```
**Output (if logged in as rajat):**
```
/home/rajat
```

---

### 🔸 Example: Go to home directory
```bash
cd ~
```

---

### 🔸 Example: List files in home directory
```bash
ls -la ~
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

Key configuration files for user & group management:

### 🔹 `/etc/login.defs`
Controls default settings for user creation.

### 🔹 `/etc/default/useradd`
Stores default values for the `useradd` command.

#### 🔸 View defaults:
```bash
cat /etc/default/useradd
```

**Output:**
```
GROUP=100
HOME=/home
SHELL=/bin/sh
SKEL=/etc/skel
```

---

## 🔄 Switching Between Users in Linux

### 🔹 Using the `su` Command

`su` = **switch user**

#### Syntax:
```bash
su [username]
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Switch to root user
```bash
su
```
**What happens?**
- Prompts for root password  
- Once authenticated, you become root  
- Prompt changes to `#`  

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Switch to specific user
```bash
su rajat
```
**What happens?**
- You switch to user `rajat`  
- Prompts for rajat's password  
- Prompt shows `rajat@hostname:~$`  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Login as user with login shell
```bash
su - rajat
```
**What happens?**
- Switches to `rajat`  
- Loads rajat's environment variables  
- Better for security  

---

### 🔹 Exit from switched user
```bash
exit
```
**What happens?**
- Returns to previous user  

---

## 🦸 Using the `sudo` Command

`sudo` = **superuser do**

Allows regular users to run commands with elevated privileges **without switching users**.

### 🔹 Basic Syntax
```bash
sudo command
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Run a command as root
```bash
sudo apt update
```
**What happens?**
- Command runs with root privileges  
- Prompts for current user's password (not root)  

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Create a file as root
```bash
sudo touch /etc/myconfig.conf
```
**What happens?**
- File created in `/etc` with root ownership  
- You remain logged in as regular user  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Edit a system file
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hostname
```
**What happens?**
- Opens file editor with root privileges  
- You can save changes to protected files  

---

### 🔹 Checking sudo privileges
```bash
sudo -l
```
**Output example:**
```
User rajat may run the following commands on server:
    (ALL) ALL
```

---

## 📋 Comparing `su` vs `sudo`

| Feature | `su` | `sudo` |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Switches user?** | Yes (full switch) | No (runs single command) |
| **Password** | Target user's password | Current user's password |
| **Overhead** | High (new shell) | Low (single command) |
| **Security** | Less secure | More secure |
| **Log trail** | Minimal | Detailed logging |
| **Use case** | Full system access | One-off privileged tasks |

## ⭐ Real-World DevOps Scenarios

### 🔸 Scenario 1: Add a new DevOps engineer to the team
```bash
# Create user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -c "Alice DevOps" alice

# Set password
sudo passwd alice

# Add to docker group (for container work)
sudo usermod -aG docker alice

# Add to sudo group (for admin access)
sudo usermod -aG sudo alice

# Verify
groups alice
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 2: Create a deployment user for CI/CD
```bash
# Create deployment user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash deployer

# Set password
sudo passwd deployer

# Add to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker deployer

# Allow sudo without password (add to sudoers)
# Note: Use 'visudo' for safe editing
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 3: Remove a user after they leave
```bash
# Remove user and home directory
sudo userdel -r john

# Remove from all groups (if not deleted)
# Already handled by userdel -r
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 4: Give temporary sudo access
```bash
# Add user to sudo group
sudo usermod -aG sudo contractor

# After work is done, remove
sudo delgroup contractor sudo
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

✅ **Root user** (UID 0) has full system access  
✅ **System users** (1-999) run background services  
✅ **Regular users** (1000+) are human users  
✅ Use `useradd -m -s /bin/bash` to create users properly  
✅ Always set passwords with `sudo passwd`  
✅ Manage groups with `usermod -aG`  
✅ Use `sudo` for security (not `su`)  
✅ Check `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/group` for user info
