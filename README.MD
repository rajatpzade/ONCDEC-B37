### Kernel : 
    In simple terms, the Linux kernel is the core of the operating system that acts as a translator between software and hardware. It manages essential resources like the CPU and memory, and handles all communication, allowing applications to run without needing to know the specific details of the computer's hardware.  


### Shell :
```
A Linux shell is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system's core, known as the kernel
```

### Hardware :

```
 Linux hardware is any physical component of a computer, like the CPU, RAM, and storage drives, that the Linux operating system manages and interacts

```

- `@` → Separator  
- `hostname` → System name  
- `:` → Separator  
- `~` → Current directory (home directory)  
- `$` → Normal user prompt (`#` for root user)

---

## 🧭 Effective Command Prompt Usage: A Step-by-Step Guide
- Identify your **user** and **location**  
- Understand the **$** vs **#** prompt difference  
- Use **TAB** for auto-completion  
- Use **UP/DOWN arrows** to navigate history  
- Use **CTRL + C** to stop running commands  
- Use **clear** or **CTRL + L** to clean the screen  

---

## 🎨 Making the Command Prompt Your Own (Advanced Customization)
You can customize your prompt by editing the PS1 variable.

Example:

`
PS1="\u@\h:\w$ "
`

Meaning:  
- `\u` → Username  
- `\h` → Hostname

### 🔸 Example 5: Create user and assign to group
```bash
sudo useradd -m -g developers -G docker,sudo alice
```
**What happens?**
- User `alice` created  
- Primary group: `developers`  
- Secondary groups: `docker`, `sudo`  

---

## 🔐 Setting User Passwords

After creating a user, you must set a password.

### 🔹 Using the `passwd` Command

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo passwd username
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Set password for a user
```bash
sudo passwd rajat
```
**Output:**
```
New password: [type password]
Retype new password: [confirm password]
passwd: password updated successfully
```

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Force user to change password on first login
```bash
sudo passwd -e rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User must change password on next login  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Lock a user account
```bash
sudo passwd -l john
```
**What happens?**
- User `john` cannot login  
- Password is locked with `!`  

---

### 🔸 Example 4: Unlock a user account
```bash
sudo passwd -u john
```
**What happens?**
- User `john` can login again  

---

## 👥 Managing User Groups

Groups are used to organize users and assign permissions collectively.

### 🔹 Viewing Groups
```bash
cat /etc/group
```
**Output:**
```
root:x:0:
sudo:x:27:rajat,alice
docker:x:999:rajat
developers:x:1001:alice,bob
```

---

### 🔹 Creating Groups
```bash
sudo groupadd groupname
```

#### 🔸 Example 1: Create a simple group
```bash
sudo groupadd developers
```

#### 🔸 Example 2: Create a group with specific GID
```bash
sudo groupadd -g 2000 devops_team
```

---

### 🔹 Adding User to Group

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username
```

#### 🔸 Example 1: Add user to sudo group
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` can now run commands with `sudo`  

---

#### 🔸 Example 2: Add user to docker group
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` can run Docker commands without `sudo`  

---

#### 🔸 Example 3: Add user to multiple groups
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker,developers,sudo rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` added to three groups  

---

### 🔹 Viewing User's Groups
```bash
groups username
```

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
groups rajat
```
**Output:**
```
rajat : rajat docker developers sudo
```

---

### 🔹 Removing User from Group
```bash
sudo delgroup username groupname
```

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
sudo delgroup rajat docker
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` removed from `docker` group  

---

## 🗑️ Removing Users

### 🔹 Delete User (keep home directory)
```bash
sudo userdel username
```

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
sudo userdel john
```
**What happens?**
- User `john` deleted  
- Home directory `/home/john` still exists  

---

### 🔹 Delete User with Home Directory
```bash
sudo userdel -r username
```

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
sudo userdel -r john
```
**What happens?**
- User `john` deleted  
- Home directory `/home/john` deleted  

---

## 📄 Introduction to Affected Files

User and group information is stored in specific files:

### 🔹 `/etc/passwd`
Stores user account information.

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

**Output:**
```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
rajat:x:1000:1000:Rajat Kumar:/home/rajat:/bin/bash
john:x:1001:1001:John Doe:/home/john:/bin/bash
mysql:x:111:113:MySQL Server:/var/lib/mysql:/bin/false
```

**Format:**
```
username:x:UID:GID:Full Name:Home Directory:Shell
```

---

### 🔹 `/etc/shadow`
Stores encrypted passwords (only root can read).

#### 🔸 View shadow file:
```bash
sudo cat /etc/shadow
```

**Output:**
```
root:!:18305:0:99999:7:::
rajat:$6$abc123....:18305:0:99999:7:::
john:!:18305:0:99999:7:::
```

---

### 🔹 `/etc/group`
Stores group information.

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
cat /etc/group
```

**Output:**
```
root:x:0:
sudo:x:27:rajat,alice
docker:x:999:rajat
developers:x:1001:alice,bob
```

**Format:**
```
groupname:x:GID:members
```

---

## 🏠 User Home Directories

Each user has a personal home directory.

### 🔹 Default Home Directory Location
```bash
/home/username
```

### 🔹 Special Home Directories
- **Root user**: `/root`  
- **Regular users**: `/home/username`  
- **System users**: Varies (e.g., `/var/lib/mysql` for mysql)  

---

### 🔸 Example: View your home directory
```bash
pwd
```
**Output (if logged in as rajat):**
```
/home/rajat
```

---

### 🔸 Example: Go to home directory
```bash
cd ~
```

---

### 🔸 Example: List files in home directory
```bash
ls -la ~
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

Key configuration files for user & group management:

### 🔹 `/etc/login.defs`
Controls default settings for user creation.

### 🔹 `/etc/default/useradd`
Stores default values for the `useradd` command.

#### 🔸 View defaults:
```bash
cat /etc/default/useradd
```

**Output:**
```
GROUP=100
HOME=/home
SHELL=/bin/sh
SKEL=/etc/skel
```

---

## 🔄 Switching Between Users in Linux

### 🔹 Using the `su` Command

`su` = **switch user**

#### Syntax:
```bash
su [username]
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Switch to root user
```bash
su
```
**What happens?**
- Prompts for root password  
- Once authenticated, you become root  
- Prompt changes to `#`  

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Switch to specific user
```bash
su rajat
```
**What happens?**
- You switch to user `rajat`  
- Prompts for rajat's password  
- Prompt shows `rajat@hostname:~$`  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Login as user with login shell
```bash
su - rajat
```
**What happens?**
- Switches to `rajat`  
- Loads rajat's environment variables  
- Better for security  

---

### 🔹 Exit from switched user
```bash
exit
```
**What happens?**
- Returns to previous user  

---

## 🦸 Using the `sudo` Command

`sudo` = **superuser do**

Allows regular users to run commands with elevated privileges **without switching users**.

### 🔹 Basic Syntax
```bash
sudo command
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Run a command as root
```bash
sudo apt update
```
**What happens?**
- Command runs with root privileges  
- Prompts for current user's password (not root)  

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Create a file as root
```bash
sudo touch /etc/myconfig.conf
```
**What happens?**
- File created in `/etc` with root ownership  
- You remain logged in as regular user  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Edit a system file
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hostname
```
**What happens?**
- Opens file editor with root privileges  
- You can save changes to protected files  

---

### 🔹 Checking sudo privileges
```bash
sudo -l
```
**Output example:**
```
User rajat may run the following commands on server:
    (ALL) ALL
```

---

## 📋 Comparing `su` vs `sudo`

| Feature | `su` | `sudo` |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Switches user?** | Yes (full switch) | No (runs single command) |
| **Password** | Target user's password | Current user's password |
| **Overhead** | High (new shell) | Low (single command) |
| **Security** | Less secure | More secure |
| **Log trail** | Minimal | Detailed logging |
| **Use case** | Full system access | One-off privileged tasks |

## ⭐ Real-World DevOps Scenarios

### 🔸 Scenario 1: Add a new DevOps engineer to the team
```bash
# Create user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -c "Alice DevOps" alice

# Set password
sudo passwd alice

# Add to docker group (for container work)
sudo usermod -aG docker alice

# Add to sudo group (for admin access)
sudo usermod -aG sudo alice

# Verify
groups alice
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 2: Create a deployment user for CI/CD
```bash
# Create deployment user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash deployer

# Set password
sudo passwd deployer

# Add to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker deployer

# Allow sudo without password (add to sudoers)
# Note: Use 'visudo' for safe editing
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 3: Remove a user after they leave
```bash
# Remove user and home directory
sudo userdel -r john

# Remove from all groups (if not deleted)
# Already handled by userdel -r
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 4: Give temporary sudo access
```bash
# Add user to sudo group
sudo usermod -aG sudo contractor

# After work is done, remove
sudo delgroup contractor sudo
```

# 🔐 Password Security and Advanced User Management

## Day-10 📌 Overview
Password security is the foundation of Linux system security.  
Understanding password policies, account locking, and advanced group management is essential for DevOps engineers.

---

## 🔑 Importance of Password Security

### Why Strong Passwords Matter?
- **Prevents unauthorized access** to systems and data  
- **Protects sensitive information** from attackers  
- **Ensures compliance** with security standards  
- **Reduces risk** of data breaches  
- **Maintains system integrity** in production environments  

### 🔸 Strong Password Characteristics
- Minimum **12 characters** long  
- Mix of **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**  
- **Not based on dictionary words**  
- **Not easily guessable** (avoid birthdays, names)  
- **Unique** (different for each account)  

### ⚠️ Common Password Mistakes to Avoid
- Using simple passwords like `password123`  
- Reusing passwords across multiple accounts  
- Writing passwords on sticky notes  
- Sharing passwords with colleagues  
- Using default passwords  

---

## 🔐 Using the `passwd` Command

The `passwd` command is the primary tool for password management in Linux.

### 🔹 Basic Syntax
```bash
sudo passwd username
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Change your own password
```bash
passwd
```
**What happens?**
- You're prompted for current password  
- Then prompted to enter new password twice  
- Output: `passwd: password updated successfully`

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Change another user's password (as root)
```bash
sudo passwd rajat
```
**What happens?**
- Root can change any user's password  
- Doesn't require old password verification  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Force password change on next login
```bash
sudo passwd -e rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` must change password at next login  
- Login prompt: `You are required to change your password immediately`  

---

### 🔸 Example 4: Lock a user account
```bash
sudo passwd -l rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` cannot login  
- A `!` is added to the password hash in `/etc/shadow`  
- Error message: `Authentication token manipulation error`  

---

### 🔸 Example 5: Unlock a user account
```bash
sudo passwd -u rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` can login again  
- The `!` prefix is removed from password hash  

---

### 🔸 Example 6: Disable login without removing password
```bash
sudo passwd -l rajat
sudo usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User cannot login interactively  
- But can still be used for system processes  

---

## 📋 Password Policy Settings

Password policies enforce security standards across the system.

### 🔹 `/etc/login.defs` Configuration
This file contains default password policies.

#### 🔸 View password policies:
```bash
cat /etc/login.defs | grep PASS
```

**Output:**
```
PASS_MAX_DAYS   99999
PASS_MIN_DAYS   0
PASS_WARN_AGE   7
PASS_MIN_LEN    5
```

### 🔹 Understanding Policy Fields

| Field | Meaning | Default | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| `PASS_MAX_DAYS` | Max days password valid | 99999 | 90 days |
| `PASS_MIN_DAYS` | Min days before changing | 0 | 1 day |
| `PASS_WARN_AGE` | Days before expiry warning | 7 | 14 days |
| `PASS_MIN_LEN` | Minimum password length | 5 | 12 chars |

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Set password to expire every 90 days
Edit `/etc/login.defs`:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/login.defs
```

Change:
```
PASS_MAX_DAYS   90
```

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Require minimum 12 character passwords
```bash
sudo nano /etc/login.defs
```

Change:
```
PASS_MIN_LEN    12
```

---

### 🔹 Using `pam_pwquality` for Strong Passwords

Install password quality checker:
```bash
sudo apt install libpam-pwquality
```

---

## 🔒 Account Locking and Expiration

### 🔹 Using `chage` Command

`chage` = **change age** - manages password expiration and account lockout.

```bash
sudo chage [options] username
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: View password aging info
```bash
sudo chage -l rajat
```

**Output:**
```
Last password change                    : Dec 08, 2025
Password expires                        : never
Password inactive                       : never
Account expires                         : never
Minimum number of days between changes  : 0
Maximum number of days between changes  : 99999
Number of days of warning before expiry : 7
```

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Set password to expire in 90 days
```bash
sudo chage -M 90 rajat
```
**What happens?**
- Password must be changed every 90 days  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Set minimum days between password changes
```bash
sudo chage -m 1 rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User must wait at least 1 day before changing password again  

---

### 🔸 Example 4: Set password expiration warning
```bash
sudo chage -W 14 rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User gets warning 14 days before password expires  

---

### 🔸 Example 5: Set account expiration date
```bash
sudo chage -E 2026-12-31 rajat
```
**What happens?**
- Account `rajat` will be disabled on December 31, 2026  
- User cannot login after this date  

---

### 🔸 Example 6: Set all password policies at once
```bash
sudo chage -M 90 -m 1 -W 14 -I 7 rajat
```
**What happens?**
- Max days: 90  
- Min days: 1  
- Warning: 14 days

## 🎯 Types of Groups

### 🔹 1. Primary Group
- Automatically created when user is created  
- User's primary group (found in `/etc/passwd`)  
- Has same name as username  
- One user = one primary group  

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep rajat
```
**Output:**
```
rajat:x:1000:1000:Rajat Kumar:/home/rajat:/bin/bash
```
**Meaning:** GID 1000 is rajat's primary group

---

### 🔹 2. Secondary Groups
- Additional groups a user belongs to  
- Provides extra permissions  
- Can be shared among users  
- One user = multiple secondary groups  

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
groups rajat
```
**Output:**
```
rajat docker sudo developers
```
**Meaning:** 
- Primary: `rajat`  
- Secondary: `docker`, `sudo`, `developers`  

---

### 🔹 3. System Groups
- GID: 0-999  
- Used for system services  
- Examples: `root`, `bin`, `daemon`, `www-data`  

#### 🔸 View system groups:
```bash
cat /etc/group | head -20
```

---

## ➕ Creating and Deleting Groups

### 🔹 Creating Groups

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo groupadd [options] groupname
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Create a simple group
```bash
sudo groupadd developers
```
**What happens?**
- Group `developers` created with auto-assigned GID  

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Create group with specific GID
```bash
sudo groupadd -g 2000 devops_team
```
**What happens?**
- Group created with GID 2000  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Create system group
```bash
sudo groupadd -r ci_system
```
**What happens?**
- Group created with system GID range (1-999)  

---

### 🔹 Deleting Groups

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo groupdel groupname
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Delete a group
```bash
sudo groupdel developers
```
**What happens?**
- Group `developers` is deleted  
- Error if group is primary group of any user  

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Delete group and reassign users
```bash
# First remove users from group or change their primary group
sudo usermod -g other_group username

# Then delete group
sudo groupdel developers
```

---

## 🔧 Modifying Groups

### 🔹 Using `groupmod` Command

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo groupmod [options] groupname
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Change group name
```bash
sudo groupmod -n new_name old_name
```
**What happens?**
- Group `old_name` renamed to `new_name`  

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
sudo groupmod -n backend developers
```

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Change group GID
```bash
sudo groupmod -g 3000 developers
```
**What happens?**
- Group `developers` GID changed to 3000  
- Files still belong to old GID (needs manual fix)  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Change group password
```bash
sudo groupmod -p encrypted_password developers
```

---

## 👥 Managing Group Memberships

### 🔹 Adding Users to Groups

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username
```

**Flag Meaning:**
- `-a` = Append (add to existing groups)  
- `-G` = Groups (specify additional groups)  
- ⚠️ Without `-a`, user is REMOVED from other groups!  

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Add user to docker group
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` added to `docker` group  
- Retains all other group memberships  

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Add user to multiple groups
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker,sudo,developers rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` added to three groups at once  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Replace all groups (without -a)
```bash
sudo usermod -G docker rajat
```
⚠️ **Warning!**
- User `rajat` REMOVED from all groups except `docker`  
- Can cause permission issues  
- Always use `-aG` instead!  

---

### 🔹 Removing Users from Groups

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo delgroup username groupname

### 🔸 Example 1: Remove user from docker group
```bash
sudo delgroup rajat docker
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` removed from `docker` group  
- Other groups remain unchanged  

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Remove user from multiple groups
```bash
sudo delgroup rajat docker
sudo delgroup rajat sudo
sudo delgroup rajat developers
```

---

### 🔹 Verifying Group Membership

#### Check user's groups:
```bash
groups rajat
```
**Output:**
```
rajat : rajat docker developers sudo
```

---

#### Check group members:
```bash
getent group docker
```
**Output:**
```
docker:x:999:rajat,bob,alice
```

---

## 🔍 Viewing and Editing Group Information

### 🔹 Viewing Group Details

#### All groups on system:
```bash
cat /etc/group
```

---

#### Specific group info:
```bash
getent group developers
```
**Output:**
```
developers:x:1001:alice,john,rajat
```

---

#### All groups for a user:
```bash
groups rajat
```

---

#### Group ID of a user's primary group:
```bash
id rajat
```
**Output:**
```
uid=1000(rajat) gid=1000(rajat) groups=1000(rajat),999(docker),27(sudo),1001(developers)
```

---

### 🔹 Editing Group Information Safely

⚠️ **Never edit `/etc/group` or `/etc/gshadow` directly!**  
Use proper commands instead:

#### ✅ Correct Way:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker rajat
sudo groupmod -n newname oldname
sudo groupdel groupname
```

#### ❌ Wrong Way:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/group          # Don't do this!
sudo vi /etc/gshadow          # Don't do this!
```

---

### 🔹 Checking Group Syntax

If you must edit manually, validate syntax:
```bash
sudo grpck
```
**Output:**
```
(no errors or errors listed)
```

## ⭐ Real-World DevOps Scenarios

### 🔸 Scenario 1: Onboard new DevOps engineer
```bash
# Create user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -c "Bob Engineer" bob

# Set password
sudo passwd bob

# Add to required groups
sudo usermod -aG docker,sudo,developers bob

# Set strong password policy
sudo chage -M 90 -m 1 -W 14 -I 7 bob

# Verify setup
groups bob
id bob
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 2: Create CI/CD deployment group
```bash
# Create group
sudo groupadd cicd_team

# Create deployment user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash deployer

# Add user to group
sudo usermod -aG cicd_team deployer

# Set password policy (no expiration for automation)
sudo chage -E -1 deployer

# Verify
getent group cicd_team
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 3: Enforce password policy company-wide
```bash
# Edit login.defs
sudo nano /etc/login.defs

# Change these values:
# PASS_MAX_DAYS   90
# PASS_MIN_DAYS   1
# PASS_WARN_AGE   14
# PASS_MIN_LEN    12

# Apply to existing users
for user in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd | grep -v root); do
  sudo chage -M 90 -m 1 -W 14 $user
done
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 4: Audit user accounts and cleanup
```bash
# List all users with expiration dates
for user in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd); do
  sudo chage -l $user | grep "Account expires"
done

# Remove inactive user
sudo userdel -r old_contractor

# Ensure group cleanup
sudo groupdel unused_group
```

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

✅ Strong passwords are **foundation of security**  
✅ Use `passwd -e` to force password change  
✅ Use `passwd -l` to lock accounts  
✅ Use `chage` for password expiration policies  
✅ Always use `usermod -aG` (never omit `-a`)  
✅ Primary group created automatically with user  
✅ Secondary groups provide additional permissions  
✅ Never edit `/etc/group` directly  
✅ Use `groups` command to verify membership  
✅ `getent` shows all groups on system
