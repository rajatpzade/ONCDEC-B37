### Kernel : 
    In simple terms, the Linux kernel is the core of the operating system that acts as a translator between software and hardware. It manages essential resources like the CPU and memory, and handles all communication, allowing applications to run without needing to know the specific details of the computer's hardware.  


### Shell :
```
A Linux shell is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system's core, known as the kernel
```

### Hardware :

```
 Linux hardware is any physical component of a computer, like the CPU, RAM, and storage drives, that the Linux operating system manages and interacts

```

- `@` → Separator  
- `hostname` → System name  
- `:` → Separator  
- `~` → Current directory (home directory)  
- `$` → Normal user prompt (`#` for root user)

---

## 🧭 Effective Command Prompt Usage: A Step-by-Step Guide
- Identify your **user** and **location**  
- Understand the **$** vs **#** prompt difference  
- Use **TAB** for auto-completion  
- Use **UP/DOWN arrows** to navigate history  
- Use **CTRL + C** to stop running commands  
- Use **clear** or **CTRL + L** to clean the screen  

---

## 🎨 Making the Command Prompt Your Own (Advanced Customization)
You can customize your prompt by editing the PS1 variable.

Example:

`
PS1="\u@\h:\w$ "
`

Meaning:  
- `\u` → Username  
- `\h` → Hostname

### 🔸 Example 5: Create user and assign to group
```bash
sudo useradd -m -g developers -G docker,sudo alice
```
**What happens?**
- User `alice` created  
- Primary group: `developers`  
- Secondary groups: `docker`, `sudo`  

---

## 🔐 Setting User Passwords

After creating a user, you must set a password.

### 🔹 Using the `passwd` Command

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo passwd username
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Set password for a user
```bash
sudo passwd rajat
```
**Output:**
```
New password: [type password]
Retype new password: [confirm password]
passwd: password updated successfully
```

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Force user to change password on first login
```bash
sudo passwd -e rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User must change password on next login  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Lock a user account
```bash
sudo passwd -l john
```
**What happens?**
- User `john` cannot login  
- Password is locked with `!`  

---

### 🔸 Example 4: Unlock a user account
```bash
sudo passwd -u john
```
**What happens?**
- User `john` can login again  

---

## 👥 Managing User Groups

Groups are used to organize users and assign permissions collectively.

### 🔹 Viewing Groups
```bash
cat /etc/group
```
**Output:**
```
root:x:0:
sudo:x:27:rajat,alice
docker:x:999:rajat
developers:x:1001:alice,bob
```

---

### 🔹 Creating Groups
```bash
sudo groupadd groupname
```

#### 🔸 Example 1: Create a simple group
```bash
sudo groupadd developers
```

#### 🔸 Example 2: Create a group with specific GID
```bash
sudo groupadd -g 2000 devops_team
```

---

### 🔹 Adding User to Group

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username
```

#### 🔸 Example 1: Add user to sudo group
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` can now run commands with `sudo`  

---

#### 🔸 Example 2: Add user to docker group
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` can run Docker commands without `sudo`  

---

#### 🔸 Example 3: Add user to multiple groups
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker,developers,sudo rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` added to three groups  

---

### 🔹 Viewing User's Groups
```bash
groups username
```

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
groups rajat
```
**Output:**
```
rajat : rajat docker developers sudo
```

---

### 🔹 Removing User from Group
```bash
sudo delgroup username groupname
```

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
sudo delgroup rajat docker
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` removed from `docker` group  

---

## 🗑️ Removing Users

### 🔹 Delete User (keep home directory)
```bash
sudo userdel username
```

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
sudo userdel john
```
**What happens?**
- User `john` deleted  
- Home directory `/home/john` still exists  

---

### 🔹 Delete User with Home Directory
```bash
sudo userdel -r username
```

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
sudo userdel -r john
```
**What happens?**
- User `john` deleted  
- Home directory `/home/john` deleted  

---

## 📄 Introduction to Affected Files

User and group information is stored in specific files:

### 🔹 `/etc/passwd`
Stores user account information.

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

**Output:**
```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
rajat:x:1000:1000:Rajat Kumar:/home/rajat:/bin/bash
john:x:1001:1001:John Doe:/home/john:/bin/bash
mysql:x:111:113:MySQL Server:/var/lib/mysql:/bin/false
```

**Format:**
```
username:x:UID:GID:Full Name:Home Directory:Shell
```

---

### 🔹 `/etc/shadow`
Stores encrypted passwords (only root can read).

#### 🔸 View shadow file:
```bash
sudo cat /etc/shadow
```

**Output:**
```
root:!:18305:0:99999:7:::
rajat:$6$abc123....:18305:0:99999:7:::
john:!:18305:0:99999:7:::
```

---

### 🔹 `/etc/group`
Stores group information.

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
cat /etc/group
```

**Output:**
```
root:x:0:
sudo:x:27:rajat,alice
docker:x:999:rajat
developers:x:1001:alice,bob
```

**Format:**
```
groupname:x:GID:members
```

---

## 🏠 User Home Directories

Each user has a personal home directory.

### 🔹 Default Home Directory Location
```bash
/home/username
```

### 🔹 Special Home Directories
- **Root user**: `/root`  
- **Regular users**: `/home/username`  
- **System users**: Varies (e.g., `/var/lib/mysql` for mysql)  

---

### 🔸 Example: View your home directory
```bash
pwd
```
**Output (if logged in as rajat):**
```
/home/rajat
```

---

### 🔸 Example: Go to home directory
```bash
cd ~
```

---

### 🔸 Example: List files in home directory
```bash
ls -la ~
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

Key configuration files for user & group management:

### 🔹 `/etc/login.defs`
Controls default settings for user creation.

### 🔹 `/etc/default/useradd`
Stores default values for the `useradd` command.

#### 🔸 View defaults:
```bash
cat /etc/default/useradd
```

**Output:**
```
GROUP=100
HOME=/home
SHELL=/bin/sh
SKEL=/etc/skel
```

---

## 🔄 Switching Between Users in Linux

### 🔹 Using the `su` Command

`su` = **switch user**

#### Syntax:
```bash
su [username]
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Switch to root user
```bash
su
```
**What happens?**
- Prompts for root password  
- Once authenticated, you become root  
- Prompt changes to `#`  

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Switch to specific user
```bash
su rajat
```
**What happens?**
- You switch to user `rajat`  
- Prompts for rajat's password  
- Prompt shows `rajat@hostname:~$`  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Login as user with login shell
```bash
su - rajat
```
**What happens?**
- Switches to `rajat`  
- Loads rajat's environment variables  
- Better for security  

---

### 🔹 Exit from switched user
```bash
exit
```
**What happens?**
- Returns to previous user  

---

## 🦸 Using the `sudo` Command

`sudo` = **superuser do**

Allows regular users to run commands with elevated privileges **without switching users**.

### 🔹 Basic Syntax
```bash
sudo command
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Run a command as root
```bash
sudo apt update
```
**What happens?**
- Command runs with root privileges  
- Prompts for current user's password (not root)  

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Create a file as root
```bash
sudo touch /etc/myconfig.conf
```
**What happens?**
- File created in `/etc` with root ownership  
- You remain logged in as regular user  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Edit a system file
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hostname
```
**What happens?**
- Opens file editor with root privileges  
- You can save changes to protected files  

---

### 🔹 Checking sudo privileges
```bash
sudo -l
```
**Output example:**
```
User rajat may run the following commands on server:
    (ALL) ALL
```

---

## 📋 Comparing `su` vs `sudo`

| Feature | `su` | `sudo` |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Switches user?** | Yes (full switch) | No (runs single command) |
| **Password** | Target user's password | Current user's password |
| **Overhead** | High (new shell) | Low (single command) |
| **Security** | Less secure | More secure |
| **Log trail** | Minimal | Detailed logging |
| **Use case** | Full system access | One-off privileged tasks |

## ⭐ Real-World DevOps Scenarios

### 🔸 Scenario 1: Add a new DevOps engineer to the team
```bash
# Create user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -c "Alice DevOps" alice

# Set password
sudo passwd alice

# Add to docker group (for container work)
sudo usermod -aG docker alice

# Add to sudo group (for admin access)
sudo usermod -aG sudo alice

# Verify
groups alice
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 2: Create a deployment user for CI/CD
```bash
# Create deployment user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash deployer

# Set password
sudo passwd deployer

# Add to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker deployer

# Allow sudo without password (add to sudoers)
# Note: Use 'visudo' for safe editing
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 3: Remove a user after they leave
```bash
# Remove user and home directory
sudo userdel -r john

# Remove from all groups (if not deleted)
# Already handled by userdel -r
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 4: Give temporary sudo access
```bash
# Add user to sudo group
sudo usermod -aG sudo contractor

# After work is done, remove
sudo delgroup contractor sudo
```

# 🔐 Password Security and Advanced User Management

## Day-10 📌 Overview
Password security is the foundation of Linux system security.  
Understanding password policies, account locking, and advanced group management is essential for DevOps engineers.

---

## 🔑 Importance of Password Security

### Why Strong Passwords Matter?
- **Prevents unauthorized access** to systems and data  
- **Protects sensitive information** from attackers  
- **Ensures compliance** with security standards  
- **Reduces risk** of data breaches  
- **Maintains system integrity** in production environments  

### 🔸 Strong Password Characteristics
- Minimum **12 characters** long  
- Mix of **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**  
- **Not based on dictionary words**  
- **Not easily guessable** (avoid birthdays, names)  
- **Unique** (different for each account)  

### ⚠️ Common Password Mistakes to Avoid
- Using simple passwords like `password123`  
- Reusing passwords across multiple accounts  
- Writing passwords on sticky notes  
- Sharing passwords with colleagues  
- Using default passwords  

---

## 🔐 Using the `passwd` Command

The `passwd` command is the primary tool for password management in Linux.

### 🔹 Basic Syntax
```bash
sudo passwd username
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Change your own password
```bash
passwd
```
**What happens?**
- You're prompted for current password  
- Then prompted to enter new password twice  
- Output: `passwd: password updated successfully`

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Change another user's password (as root)
```bash
sudo passwd rajat
```
**What happens?**
- Root can change any user's password  
- Doesn't require old password verification  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Force password change on next login
```bash
sudo passwd -e rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` must change password at next login  
- Login prompt: `You are required to change your password immediately`  

---

### 🔸 Example 4: Lock a user account
```bash
sudo passwd -l rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` cannot login  
- A `!` is added to the password hash in `/etc/shadow`  
- Error message: `Authentication token manipulation error`  

---

### 🔸 Example 5: Unlock a user account
```bash
sudo passwd -u rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` can login again  
- The `!` prefix is removed from password hash  

---

### 🔸 Example 6: Disable login without removing password
```bash
sudo passwd -l rajat
sudo usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User cannot login interactively  
- But can still be used for system processes  

---

## 📋 Password Policy Settings

Password policies enforce security standards across the system.

### 🔹 `/etc/login.defs` Configuration
This file contains default password policies.

#### 🔸 View password policies:
```bash
cat /etc/login.defs | grep PASS
```

**Output:**
```
PASS_MAX_DAYS   99999
PASS_MIN_DAYS   0
PASS_WARN_AGE   7
PASS_MIN_LEN    5
```

### 🔹 Understanding Policy Fields

| Field | Meaning | Default | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| `PASS_MAX_DAYS` | Max days password valid | 99999 | 90 days |
| `PASS_MIN_DAYS` | Min days before changing | 0 | 1 day |
| `PASS_WARN_AGE` | Days before expiry warning | 7 | 14 days |
| `PASS_MIN_LEN` | Minimum password length | 5 | 12 chars |

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Set password to expire every 90 days
Edit `/etc/login.defs`:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/login.defs
```

Change:
```
PASS_MAX_DAYS   90
```

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Require minimum 12 character passwords
```bash
sudo nano /etc/login.defs
```

Change:
```
PASS_MIN_LEN    12
```

---

### 🔹 Using `pam_pwquality` for Strong Passwords

Install password quality checker:
```bash
sudo apt install libpam-pwquality
```

---

## 🔒 Account Locking and Expiration

### 🔹 Using `chage` Command

`chage` = **change age** - manages password expiration and account lockout.

```bash
sudo chage [options] username
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: View password aging info
```bash
sudo chage -l rajat
```

**Output:**
```
Last password change                    : Dec 08, 2025
Password expires                        : never
Password inactive                       : never
Account expires                         : never
Minimum number of days between changes  : 0
Maximum number of days between changes  : 99999
Number of days of warning before expiry : 7
```

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Set password to expire in 90 days
```bash
sudo chage -M 90 rajat
```
**What happens?**
- Password must be changed every 90 days  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Set minimum days between password changes
```bash
sudo chage -m 1 rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User must wait at least 1 day before changing password again  

---

### 🔸 Example 4: Set password expiration warning
```bash
sudo chage -W 14 rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User gets warning 14 days before password expires  

---

### 🔸 Example 5: Set account expiration date
```bash
sudo chage -E 2026-12-31 rajat
```
**What happens?**
- Account `rajat` will be disabled on December 31, 2026  
- User cannot login after this date  

---

### 🔸 Example 6: Set all password policies at once
```bash
sudo chage -M 90 -m 1 -W 14 -I 7 rajat
```
**What happens?**
- Max days: 90  
- Min days: 1  
- Warning: 14 days

## 🎯 Types of Groups

### 🔹 1. Primary Group
- Automatically created when user is created  
- User's primary group (found in `/etc/passwd`)  
- Has same name as username  
- One user = one primary group  

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep rajat
```
**Output:**
```
rajat:x:1000:1000:Rajat Kumar:/home/rajat:/bin/bash
```
**Meaning:** GID 1000 is rajat's primary group

---

### 🔹 2. Secondary Groups
- Additional groups a user belongs to  
- Provides extra permissions  
- Can be shared among users  
- One user = multiple secondary groups  

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
groups rajat
```
**Output:**
```
rajat docker sudo developers
```
**Meaning:** 
- Primary: `rajat`  
- Secondary: `docker`, `sudo`, `developers`  

---

### 🔹 3. System Groups
- GID: 0-999  
- Used for system services  
- Examples: `root`, `bin`, `daemon`, `www-data`  

#### 🔸 View system groups:
```bash
cat /etc/group | head -20
```

---

## ➕ Creating and Deleting Groups

### 🔹 Creating Groups

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo groupadd [options] groupname
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Create a simple group
```bash
sudo groupadd developers
```
**What happens?**
- Group `developers` created with auto-assigned GID  

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Create group with specific GID
```bash
sudo groupadd -g 2000 devops_team
```
**What happens?**
- Group created with GID 2000  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Create system group
```bash
sudo groupadd -r ci_system
```
**What happens?**
- Group created with system GID range (1-999)  

---

### 🔹 Deleting Groups

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo groupdel groupname
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Delete a group
```bash
sudo groupdel developers
```
**What happens?**
- Group `developers` is deleted  
- Error if group is primary group of any user  

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Delete group and reassign users
```bash
# First remove users from group or change their primary group
sudo usermod -g other_group username

# Then delete group
sudo groupdel developers
```

---

## 🔧 Modifying Groups

### 🔹 Using `groupmod` Command

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo groupmod [options] groupname
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Change group name
```bash
sudo groupmod -n new_name old_name
```
**What happens?**
- Group `old_name` renamed to `new_name`  

#### 🔸 Example:
```bash
sudo groupmod -n backend developers
```

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Change group GID
```bash
sudo groupmod -g 3000 developers
```
**What happens?**
- Group `developers` GID changed to 3000  
- Files still belong to old GID (needs manual fix)  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Change group password
```bash
sudo groupmod -p encrypted_password developers
```

---

## 👥 Managing Group Memberships

### 🔹 Adding Users to Groups

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG groupname username
```

**Flag Meaning:**
- `-a` = Append (add to existing groups)  
- `-G` = Groups (specify additional groups)  
- ⚠️ Without `-a`, user is REMOVED from other groups!  

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Add user to docker group
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` added to `docker` group  
- Retains all other group memberships  

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Add user to multiple groups
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker,sudo,developers rajat
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` added to three groups at once  

---

### 🔸 Example 3: Replace all groups (without -a)
```bash
sudo usermod -G docker rajat
```
⚠️ **Warning!**
- User `rajat` REMOVED from all groups except `docker`  
- Can cause permission issues  
- Always use `-aG` instead!  

---

### 🔹 Removing Users from Groups

#### Syntax:
```bash
sudo delgroup username groupname
```

---

### 🔸 Example 1: Remove user from docker group
```bash
sudo delgroup rajat docker
```
**What happens?**
- User `rajat` removed from `docker` group  
- Other groups remain unchanged  

---

### 🔸 Example 2: Remove user from multiple groups
```bash
sudo delgroup rajat docker
sudo delgroup rajat sudo
sudo delgroup rajat developers
```

---

### 🔹 Verifying Group Membership

#### Check user's groups:
```bash
groups rajat
```
**Output:**
```
rajat : rajat docker developers sudo
```

---

#### Check group members:
```bash
getent group docker
```
**Output:**
```
docker:x:999:rajat,bob,alice
```

---

## 🔍 Viewing and Editing Group Information

### 🔹 Viewing Group Details

#### All groups on system:
```bash
cat /etc/group
```

---

#### Specific group info:
```bash
getent group developers
```
**Output:**
```
developers:x:1001:alice,john,rajat
```

---

#### All groups for a user:
```bash
groups rajat
```

---

#### Group ID of a user's primary group:
```bash
id rajat
```
**Output:**
```
uid=1000(rajat) gid=1000(rajat) groups=1000(rajat),999(docker),27(sudo),1001(developers)
```

---

### 🔹 Editing Group Information Safely

⚠️ **Never edit `/etc/group` or `/etc/gshadow` directly!**  
Use proper commands instead:

#### ✅ Correct Way:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker rajat
sudo groupmod -n newname oldname
sudo groupdel groupname
```

#### ❌ Wrong Way:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/group          # Don't do this!
sudo vi /etc/gshadow          # Don't do this!
```

---

### 🔹 Checking Group Syntax

If you must edit manually, validate syntax:
```bash
sudo grpck
```
**Output:**
```
(no errors or errors listed)
```

## ⭐ Real-World DevOps Scenarios

### 🔸 Scenario 1: Onboard new DevOps engineer
```bash
# Create user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -c "Bob Engineer" bob

# Set password
sudo passwd bob

# Add to required groups
sudo usermod -aG docker,sudo,developers bob

# Set strong password policy
sudo chage -M 90 -m 1 -W 14 -I 7 bob

# Verify setup
groups bob
id bob
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 2: Create CI/CD deployment group
```bash
# Create group
sudo groupadd cicd_team

# Create deployment user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash deployer

# Add user to group
sudo usermod -aG cicd_team deployer

# Set password policy (no expiration for automation)
sudo chage -E -1 deployer

# Verify
getent group cicd_team
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 3: Enforce password policy company-wide
```bash
# Edit login.defs
sudo nano /etc/login.defs

# Change these values:
# PASS_MAX_DAYS   90
# PASS_MIN_DAYS   1
# PASS_WARN_AGE   14
# PASS_MIN_LEN    12

# Apply to existing users
for user in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd | grep -v root); do
  sudo chage -M 90 -m 1 -W 14 $user
done
```

---

### 🔸 Scenario 4: Audit user accounts and cleanup
```bash
# List all users with expiration dates
for user in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd); do
  sudo chage -l $user | grep "Account expires"
done

# Remove inactive user
sudo userdel -r old_contractor

# Ensure group cleanup
sudo groupdel unused_group
```

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

✅ Strong passwords are **foundation of security**  
✅ Use `passwd -e` to force password change  
✅ Use `passwd -l` to lock accounts  
✅ Use `chage` for password expiration policies  
✅ Always use `usermod -aG` (never omit `-a`)  
✅ Primary group created automatically with user  
✅ Secondary groups provide additional permissions  
✅ Never edit `/etc/group` directly  
✅ Use `groups` command to verify membership  
✅ `getent` shows all groups on system

# 🔐 File Permissions in Linux — Deep Explanation

## Importance of File Permissions
- Protects data confidentiality, integrity and availability.  
- Restricts who can read, modify, or execute files and directories.  
- Prevents accidental or malicious changes.  
- Essential for multi-user systems and services (security boundary).

---

## rwx: Read, Write, Execute (what they mean)
- r (read) → For files: can view content. For directories: can list names.  
- w (write) → For files: can modify or delete. For directories: can create/delete entries.  
- x (execute) → For files: can execute as program/script. For directories: can enter (cd) and access inodes.

Permission groups: owner (user), group, others (world). Permissions are applied in this order.

---

## How Permissions Are Displayed (ls -l)
Run:
```bash
ls -l filename
```
Typical output:
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 rajat developers 1024 Dec 09 12:00 file.txt
```
Fields:
1. Permission string (10 chars)
2. Link count
3. Owner
4. Group
5. Size
6. Timestamp
7. Name

Permission string structure:
- First char = file type (e.g., '-' file, 'd' dir, 'l' symlink)  
- Next 9 chars = owner (rwx), group (rwx), others (rwx)

---

## Example: Breaking Down -rwxr-xr--
Permission string:
```
-rwxr-xr--
```
Breakdown:
- '-' → regular file  
- Owner bits `rwx` → owner can read, write, execute (7)  
- Group bits `r-x` → group can read and execute, not write (5)  
- Others bits `r--` → others can only read (4)

Numeric representation: 754 (7 owner + 5 group + 4 others).

---

## Numeric (octal) vs Symbolic Modes

Numeric (octal):
- r=4, w=2, x=1 → sum per class.
- Example: `chmod 754 file` → owner=rwx, group=r-x, others=r--.

Symbolic:
- `chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r file`  
- Append/remove: `chmod g+w file` (add write to group), `chmod o-x file` (remove execute for others).

Examples:
```bash
chmod 644 file.txt     # owner rw-, group r--, others r--
chmod 755 script.sh    # owner rwx, group rx, others rx (common for executables)
chmod u+x script.sh    # add execute for owner
chmod g-w file.txt     # remove write for group
```

---

## Special Permission Bits (setuid, setgid, sticky)
- setuid (s in owner execute position): file runs with owner's privileges. Numeric: 4xxx.
  - Example: `chmod 4755 /usr/bin/someprog`
- setgid (s in group execute position): file runs with group privileges or directory files created inherit group. Numeric: 2xxx.
  - Example: `chmod 2755 /opt/shared`
- sticky bit (t in others execute position): on directories, only owner of file/dir or root can delete entries. Numeric: 1xxx.
  - Example: `/tmp` usually has `drwxrwxrwt` and `chmod 1777 /tmp`.

Numeric example with special bits:
```bash
chmod 1755 public_dir    # sticky + rwxr-xr-x
chmod 2775 team_dir      # setgid + rwxrwxr-x (new files inherit group)
chmod 4755 su_prog       # setuid + rwxr-xr-x
```

---

## File Types (first char in ls -l)
Symbols and meanings:
- - : regular file  
- d : directory  
- l : symbolic link  
- b : block device (e.g., /dev/sda)  
- c : character device (e.g., /dev/tty)  
- s : socket (IPC, network communication)  
- p : FIFO / named pipe

Examples:
```bash
-rw-r--r--   regular file
drwxr-xr-x   directory
lrwxrwxrwx   symlink -> target
brw-rw----   block device (usually in /dev)
crw-rw----   character device
srwxrwxrwx   socket
prw-r--r--   named pipe (FIFO)
```

# Day-12 ✅ Managing Users and Permissions in Linux

## Link Count Basics
- Link count (second column after permissions in ls -l) shows how many directory entries point to the same inode.
- For files: link count = number of hard links to that file (default 1).
- For directories: link count = number of subdirectories + 2 (for "." and "..").

Example:
```bash
ls -l file.txt
# -rw-r--r-- 2 rajat users 1024 Dec 10 12:00 file.txt   # link count = 2 (two hard links)
```

## Link Count for Directories
- A directory's link count increases by 1 when a new subdirectory is created inside it.
- Example:
```bash
mkdir project
ls -ld project        # drwxr-xr-x 2 rajat users ...
mkdir project/src
ls -ld project        # drwxr-xr-x 3 rajat users ...  (now 3: ".", "..", "src")
```

## Link Count for Files
- Creating a hard link increments the file's link count.
- Remove a hard link with rm — file data removed only when link count reaches 0.
```bash
echo hello > a.txt
ln a.txt b.txt
ls -l a.txt b.txt
# both show link count 2
rm a.txt
ls -l b.txt           # still accessible, link count 1
```

## Comparing Hard and Soft (Symbolic) Links
- Hard link:
  - Shares same inode and data as original file.
  - Cannot cross filesystem boundaries.
  - Cannot link to directories (without special privileges).
  - Created with: ln target linkname
- Soft (symbolic) link:
  - Special file that points to target path.
  - Can point across filesystems and to directories.
  - If target removed, symlink becomes dangling.
  - Created with: ln -s target linkname

Examples:
```bash
# Hard link
ln file.txt file_hard
stat file.txt file_hard   # same inode number

# Symbolic link
ln -s /etc/nginx/nginx.conf nginx.conf.symlink
ls -l nginx.conf.symlink  # shows -> /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
readlink -f nginx.conf.symlink  # resolves target
```

## Importance of sudo for Privilege Escalation
- sudo allows a permitted user to run commands as root or another user without logging in as that user.
- Benefits:
  - Avoids sharing root password.
  - Fine-grained access control and auditing (sudo logs).
  - Reduces time spent in a full root shell, minimizing accidental damage.

## Difference Between Regular User Commands and sudo Commands
- Regular user:
  - Runs with user's UID/GID and permissions.
  - Cannot modify files owned by root or perform privileged ops.
- Using sudo:
  - Command executes with elevated privileges (usually root).
  - Prompts for user's password (not root) by default.
  - Environment may differ (use sudo -i or sudo -H to get a root-like env).
  - sudo logs commands to syslog/journal for audit.

Examples:
```bash
# regular user cannot edit /etc/hosts
nano /etc/hosts        # permission denied

# with sudo
sudo nano /etc/hosts  # allowed if user in sudoers
```

## Configuring sudo Access
- Always edit sudoers via visudo to avoid syntax errors:
```bash
sudo visudo
```
- Add a user to sudo group (Debian/Ubuntu):
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo rajat
```
- Example sudoers entries:
```text
# Allow rajat to run any command as any user
rajat ALL=(ALL) ALL

# Allow user to run specific commands without password
rajat ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl, /usr/bin/restart-service
```
- Use group-based rules:
```text
%devops ALL=(ALL) ALL  # members of devops group have full sudo
```

## sudo Command Syntax and Examples
- Basic:
```bash
sudo <command>
```
- Run a command as another user:
```bash
sudo -u otheruser <command>
```
- Get an interactive root shell (preserves login environment):
```bash
sudo -i
```
- Preserve environment variables:
```bash
sudo -E <command>
```

Practical examples:
```bash
sudo apt update                      # run package update as root
sudo systemctl restart nginx         # restart service with elevated rights
sudo -u postgres psql -c "\l"        # run psql as postgres user
sudo visudo                           # safely edit sudoers
```

---

## Quick Troubleshooting Tips
- If sudo reports "user is not in the sudoers file", add the user to sudoers via a root account or a user who already has sudo.
- Use sudo -l to list allowed commands for current user:
```bash
sudo -l
```
- Always validate sudoers syntax with visudo; wrong syntax can lock out sudo access.

# Day-13 ✅ Automation and Data Handling in Linux

## Overview of Archiving

Archiving is the process of combining multiple files and directories into a single file (archive) for easier storage, transfer, and management.  
Archives help in organizing data, reducing clutter, and preparing files for backup or distribution.

### 🔹 Why Archive Files?
- **Consolidation**: Multiple files → single archive file  
- **Organization**: Group related files together  
- **Transfer**: Easier to send one file instead of many  
- **Backup**: Create snapshots of data  
- **Space Management**: Prepare for compression  

### 🔹 Common Archive Formats
- **tar**: Tape Archive (most common in Linux)  
- **zip**: Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac)  
- **rar**: Proprietary (less common in Linux)  

---

## Common Use Cases: Backups, Data Transfer, Organization

### 🔹 1. Backups
- Archive entire directories before system updates  
- Create weekly backups of user data  
- Store archives on external drives or cloud  

### 🔹 2. Data Transfer
- Bundle project files for sharing  
- Send large datasets over network  
- Upload archives to servers  

### 🔹 3. Organization
- Group log files by date  
- Archive old projects  
- Clean up scattered files  

---

## Creating and Extracting Archives with tar

`tar` is the standard archiving tool in Linux. It doesn't compress by default — just bundles files.

### 🔹 Basic Syntax
```bash
tar [options] archive-name.tar files/directories
```

### 🔹 Common Options
- `-c` → Create archive  
- `-x` → Extract archive  
- `-v` → Verbose (show progress)  
- `-f` → Specify filename  
- `-t` → List archive contents  
- `-r` → Append files to archive  
- `-C` → Change to directory  

---

### 🔸 Creating Archives

#### Example 1: Create simple archive
```bash
tar -cvf myfiles.tar file1.txt file2.txt folder/
```
**What happens?**
- Creates `myfiles.tar` containing specified files  
- `-c` create, `-v` verbose, `-f` filename  

#### Example 2: Archive entire directory
```bash
tar -cvf backup.tar /home/user/documents/
```
**What happens?**
- Archives the entire documents directory  

#### Example 3: Archive with absolute paths
```bash
tar -cvf full-backup.tar /etc /var/log
```
**What happens?**
- Includes full paths in archive  

---

### 🔸 Extracting Archives

#### Example 1: Extract to current directory
```bash
tar -xvf myfiles.tar
```
**What happens?**
- Extracts all files to current location  

#### Example 2: Extract to specific directory
```bash
tar -xvf backup.tar -C /tmp/restore/
```
**What happens?**
- Extracts to `/tmp/restore/` directory  

#### Example 3: Extract specific files
```bash
tar -xvf archive.tar file1.txt folder/
```
**What happens?**
- Only extracts specified files/folders  

---

## Managing Archive Contents

### 🔹 Listing Archive Contents
```bash
tar -tvf archive.tar
```
**Output:**
```
-rw-r--r-- user/group    1024 2023-12-10 12:00 file1.txt
drwxr-xr-x user/group       0 2023-12-10 12:00 folder/
-rw-r--r-- user/group     512 2023-12-10 12:00 folder/file2.txt
```

### 🔹 Appending Files to Archive
```bash
tar -rvf archive.tar newfile.txt
```
**What happens?**
- Adds `newfile.txt` to existing archive  

### 🔹 Verifying Archive Integrity
```bash
tar -tvf archive.tar > /dev/null
```
**What happens?**
- Checks if archive is readable (no output if OK)  

---

## Introduction to Compression

Compression reduces file sizes by removing redundant data, making files smaller for storage and transfer.

### 🔹 Why Compress?
- **Save Storage Space**: Smaller files = more storage  
- **Faster Transfers**: Less data to send over network  
- **Backup Efficiency**: Compress before archiving  

### 🔹 Lossless vs Lossy Compression
- **Lossless**: No data loss (gzip, bzip2, xz)  
- **Lossy**: Some data loss for better compression (images, audio)  

---

## The Role of Compression in Reducing File Sizes

Compression algorithms identify patterns and replace them with shorter codes.

### 🔹 How It Works
- **Repetition**: "aaaaa" → "5a"  
- **Patterns**: Common sequences replaced with symbols  
- **Dictionaries**: Build reference tables  

### 🔹 Compression Ratio
- Original: 1MB  
- Compressed: 300KB  
- Ratio: 70% reduction  

---

## Differences Between Compression Formats

| Format | Tool | Compression Ratio | Speed | Use Case |
|--------|------|-------------------|-------|----------|
| **gzip** | gzip/gunzip | Medium | Fast | General purpose |
| **bzip2** | bzip2/bunzip2 | High | Medium | Better compression |
| **xz** | xz/unxz | Highest | Slow | Maximum compression |

### 🔹 gzip (.gz)
- Fast compression/decompression  
- Good for text files  
- Used in HTTP compression  

### 🔹 bzip2 (.bz2)
- Better compression than gzip  
- Slower but smaller files  
- Good for large archives  

### 🔹 xz (.xz)
- Best compression ratio  
- Slowest but smallest files  
- Used for software packages  

---

## Using gzip and gunzip

### 🔹 Compressing Files
```bash
gzip file.txt
```
**Result:** `file.txt.gz` (original deleted)

### 🔹 Compressing with options
```bash
gzip -k file.txt    # Keep original file
gzip -9 file.txt    # Maximum compression
```

### 🔹 Decompressing Files
```bash
gunzip file.txt.gz
```
**Result:** `file.txt` (compressed deleted)

### 🔹 Decompress with options
```bash
gunzip -k file.txt.gz    # Keep compressed file
gunzip -c file.txt.gz > output.txt    # Decompress to stdout
```

---

## Using bzip2 and bunzip2

### 🔹 Compressing Files
```bash
bzip2 file.txt
```
**Result:** `file.txt.bz2`

### 🔹 Compressing with options
```bash
bzip2 -k file.txt    # Keep original
bzip2 -9 file.txt    # Maximum compression
```

### 🔹 Decompressing Files
```bash
bunzip2 file.txt.bz2
```
**Result:** `file.txt`

### 🔹 Decompress with options
```bash
bunzip2 -k file.txt.bz2    # Keep compressed
bunzip2 -c file.txt.bz2 > output.txt    # To stdout
```

---

## Using xz and unxz

### 🔹 Compressing Files
```bash
xz file.txt
```
**Result:** `file.txt.xz`

### 🔹 Compressing with options
```bash
xz -k file.txt    # Keep original
xz -9 file.txt    # Maximum compression
```

### 🔹 Decompressing Files
```bash
unxz file.txt.xz
```
**Result:** `file.txt`

### 🔹 Decompress with options
```bash
unxz -k file.txt.xz    # Keep compressed
unxz -c file.txt.xz > output.txt    # To stdout
```

---

## Combining Archiving and Compression

`tar` can compress archives on the fly using options.

### 🔹 tar with gzip
```bash
tar -czvf archive.tar.gz files/    # Create compressed archive
tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz           # Extract compressed archive
```

### 🔹 tar with bzip2
```bash
tar -cjvf archive.tar.bz2 files/   # Create
tar -xjvf archive.tar.bz2          # Extract
```

### 🔹 tar with xz
```bash
tar -cJvf archive.tar.xz files/    # Create
tar -xJvf archive.tar.xz           # Extract
```

### 🔹 Compression Options Summary
- `-z` → gzip  
- `-j` → bzip2  
- `-J` → xz  

---

## Practical: Compressing Files with tar, gzip, bzip2, xz

### 🔸 Example 1: Compress directory with tar + gzip
```bash
tar -czvf project-backup.tar.gz /home/user/project/
```
**Result:** Single compressed file

### 🔸 Example 2: Compress logs with tar + bzip2
```bash
tar -cjvf logs-backup.tar.bz2 /var/log/
```
**Result:** Smaller archive than gzip

### 🔸 Example 3: Compress software with tar + xz
```bash
tar -cJvf software.tar.xz /opt/myapp/
```
**Result:** Maximum compression

### 🔸 Example 4: Compress single file with gzip
```bash
gzip -k large-file.txt
```
**Result:** `large-file.txt.gz` + original kept

### 🔸 Example 5: Compress multiple files with bzip2
```bash
bzip2 file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```
**Result:** `file1.txt.bz2`, `file2.txt.bz2`, `file3.txt.bz2`

---

## Practical: Decompressing Files with tar, gunzip, bunzip2, unxz

### 🔸 Example 1: Extract tar.gz archive
```bash
tar -xzvf project-backup.tar.gz -C /tmp/
```
**Result:** Files extracted to `/tmp/`

### 🔸 Example 2: Extract tar.bz2 archive
```bash
tar -xjvf logs-backup.tar.bz2
```
**Result:** Logs extracted to current directory

### 🔸 Example 3: Extract tar.xz archive
```bash
tar -xJvf software.tar.xz -C /opt/
```
**Result:** Software extracted to `/opt/`

### 🔸 Example 4: Decompress gzip file
```bash
gunzip large-file.txt.gz
```
**Result:** `large-file.txt`

### 🔸 Example 5: Decompress bzip2 files
```bash
bunzip2 *.bz2
```
**Result:** All .bz2 files decompressed

## Introduction to CronTab

CronTab is a time-based job scheduler in Linux. It runs commands or scripts at specified times/dates automatically.

### 🔹 Why Use CronTab?
- **Automation**: Run tasks without manual intervention  
- **Scheduling**: Execute at specific times  
- **Maintenance**: Regular backups, updates, cleanup  

### 🔹 CronTab Components
- **Cron Daemon**: `crond` service that runs in background  
- **CronTab File**: User-specific schedule file  
- **System CronTab**: `/etc/crontab` for system-wide jobs  

---

## Understanding The CronTab Syntax

CronTab entries have 6 fields: minute, hour, day, month, weekday, command.

### 🔹 Syntax Format
```
* * * * * command
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └─ Day of week (0-7, 0=Sunday)
│ │ │ └─── Month (1-12)
│ │ └───── Day of month (1-31)
│ └─────── Hour (0-23)
└───────── Minute (0-59)
```

### 🔹 Special Characters
- `*` → Any value  
- `,` → List (1,3,5)  
- `-` → Range (1-5)  
- `/` → Step (*/5 = every 5 units)  

### 🔹 Examples
- `0 2 * * *` → Daily at 2:00 AM  
- `*/15 * * * *` → Every 15 minutes  
- `0 9-17 * * 1-5` → Weekdays 9 AM to 5 PM hourly  
- `0 0 1 * *` → First day of every month  

---

## Creating and Managing Cron Jobs

### 🔹 Editing CronTab
```bash
crontab -e    # Edit current user's crontab
```

### 🔹 Viewing CronTab
```bash
crontab -l    # List current user's jobs
```

### 🔹 Removing CronTab
```bash
crontab -r    # Remove all jobs
```

### 🔹 Editing System CronTab
```bash
sudo nano /etc/crontab    # System-wide jobs
```

---

### 🔸 Creating Cron Jobs: Examples

#### Example 1: Daily backup at 2 AM
```bash

## Automating Routine Tasks like Backups, System Updates, and Cleanup Scripts

### 🔹 Automating Backups
```bash
# Daily database backup
0 2 * * * mysqldump -u root -p'password' mydb > /backup/db-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).sql

# Weekly full backup
0 3 * * 0 tar -czf /backup/weekly-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).tar.gz /home/
```

### 🔹 System Updates
```bash
# Daily security updates
0 4 * * * apt update && apt upgrade -y

# Reboot after kernel update (if needed)
0 5 * * * [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ] && reboot
```

### 🔹 Cleanup Scripts
```bash
# Clean temp files daily
0 1 * * * rm -rf /tmp/* /var/tmp/*

# Rotate logs weekly
0 2 * * 0 logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf

# Remove old backups (keep last 7)
0 3 * * * find /backup -name "*.tar.gz" -mtime +7 -delete
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

✅ **Archiving** bundles files for organization and transfer  
✅ **tar** creates archives, combine with `-z/-j/-J` for compression  
✅ **gzip** fast, **bzip2** better compression, **xz** best compression  
✅ **CronTab** automates tasks with time-based scheduling  
✅ Use `crontab -e` to edit, `crontab -l` to list jobs  
✅ Test cron jobs manually before scheduling  
✅ Always use absolute paths in cron commands

## 📝 Quick Reference: Archiving, Compression & Cron Commands

```bash
# ARCHIVING WITH TAR
tar -cvf archive.tar files/          # Create archive
tar -xvf archive.tar                 # Extract archive
tar -tvf archive.tar                 # List contents
tar -rvf archive.tar newfile         # Append to archive

# COMPRESSION
gzip file.txt                        # Compress to .gz
gunzip file.txt.gz                   # Decompress .gz
bzip2 file.txt                       # Compress to .bz2
bunzip2 file.txt.bz2                 # Decompress .bz2
xz file.txt                          # Compress to .xz
unxz file.txt.xz                     # Decompress .xz

# TAR + COMPRESSION
tar -czvf archive.tar.gz files/      # gzip
tar -cjvf archive.tar.bz2 files/     # bzip2
tar -cJvf archive.tar.xz files/      # xz
tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz             # extract gzip
tar -xjvf archive.tar.bz2            # extract bzip2
tar -xJvf archive.tar.xz             # extract xz

# CRONTAB
crontab -e                           # Edit crontab
crontab -l                           # List jobs
crontab -r                           # Remove all jobs
sudo crontab -e                      # Edit root crontab

# CRON SYNTAX EXAMPLES
* * * * * command                    # Every minute
0 * * * * command                    # Every hour
0 2 * * * command                    # Daily 2 AM
0 0 * * 0 command                    # Weekly Sunday midnight
0 0 1 * * command                    # Monthly 1st
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### 🔹 Cron Job Not Running
- Check `crontab -l` for syntax errors  
- Use absolute paths in commands  
- Check `/var/log/cron` or `journalctl -u cron` for errors  
- Test command manually first  

### 🔹 Archive Extraction Issues
- Use correct extraction flags (`-xzf` for .tar.gz)  
- Check permissions on target directory  
- Ensure enough disk space  

### 🔹 Compression Problems
- `gzip` can't compress already compressed files well  
- Use `file` command to check file types  
- Check available memory for large files
